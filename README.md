# Iris_Analysis

Analyzing the Iris flower dataset containing 3 species using Scikit and determining the accuracy in predictting the right species.

https://www.graphviz.org/ <br>

## Steps
In this project:
1. Iris dataset is loaded from sklearn
2. The 3 species of Iris: Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor is differentiated based on the length and width of the sepals and petals.
3. Using graphviz, the flowchart depicting the flower prediction model is plotted
4. Given a new flower, its species is predicted.
5. The accuracy in prediction is estimated.

## Details
1. Classifier created to differentiate the 3 species
2. Cross validation performed using train and test dataset to determine the accuracy efficiently

## Future Steps
1. Try the differentiation of species based on a different classifier
